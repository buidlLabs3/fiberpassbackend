# FiberPass Vault and Fiber Network Model

FiberPass uses the vault as the customer liquidity ledger and Fiber Network as payment infrastructure.

## Source of Funds

- Users load CKB into the FiberPass vault address.
- The backend records the deposit against the connected JoyID CKB wallet.
- Creating a pass reserves that user's vault balance by moving it from available balance into the pass limit.
- Charges and scheduled payouts spend from the reserved pass balance.
- Closing, revoking, or settling a pass returns unused reserved balance to that user's available vault balance.

The dashboard must show the logged-in user's vault balance and pass history, not cumulative vault funds and not the operator node wallet balance.

## Fiber Network Role

Fiber nodes are infrastructure for payment execution and future channel/app payments. They are not individual user wallets.

- App/API charges execute through the Fiber payment adapter with a real payment request.
- Scheduled invoice payouts execute through Fiber when a recipient supplies a Fiber invoice/payment request.
- Scheduled invoice payouts to plain CKB addresses execute from the vault lock because a CKB address is not a Fiber payment request.
- The Fiber node wallet may hold small operator liquidity for channel operations and fees, but user balances remain tracked by vault accounting.

## Charge Invariants

Every charge attempt must be persisted with:

- session id and owner wallet id
- amount and currency
- idempotency key for app/API requests
- service reference when supplied by an app or invoice system
- reserve status: `reserved`, `debited`, or `released`
- execution layer: `fiber` or `ckb-vault`
- proof type and proof id/transaction hash when successful
- failure code and message when blocked or failed

A successful charge increments pass spent balance exactly once. A failed charge does not spend reserved funds.
